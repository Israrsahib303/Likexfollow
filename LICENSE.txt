WHY THIS SYSTEM IS ADVANCED & PROTECTED?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This is not a standard SMM Panel script. It contains unique, high-level 
logic developed specifically for LikexFollow.com:

1. 🛡️ LEVEL-3 SECURITY PROTOCOLS:
   - Automated Console Wiper & Debugger Traps (Anti-Theft).
   - Domain-Lock Self-Destruct Mechanism.
   - Server-Side Logic Hiding (Backend is invisible to frontend users).

2. 🔄 INTELLIGENT AUTO-RESEND SYSTEM:
   - First-in-market logic that auto-detects API failures.
   - "Smart Retry" button that fixes stuck orders without duplicating them.

3. 💸 SPLIT REFUND & CANCELLATION ENGINE:
   - Custom logic to separate "Refund" (Money Back) vs "Force Cancel" (No Refund).
   - Prevents loss from spam orders while protecting user trust.

4. 📊 REAL-TIME COMMAND CENTER:
   - Dynamic Stats Dashboard calculating Live Profit/Loss.
   - Provider Error Tracking System (Detailed API Logs).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
LEGAL NOTICE
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Any attempt to steal, clone, or sell this "Backend Logic" (PHP Classes, 
API Handlers, Wallet Systems) will be considered a violation of 
Intellectual Property Rights.

The frontend design (UI) is just a shell. The real engine resides 
on the server, protected by this license.
